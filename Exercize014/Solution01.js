// # Exercise 012
// # Exercise description
// Write a function: class Solution { public boolean solution(int[] A); }that, given an array A of N integers, returns true if A contains at least two elements which differ by 1, and false</tt> otherwise.
// Examples:
// 1. Given A = [7], the function should return false
// 2. Given A = [4, 3], the function should return true
// 3. Given A = [11, 1, 8, 12, 14], the function should return true. Pair of elements which differ by 1 is (11, 12)
// 4. Given A = [4, 10, 8, 5, 9], the function should return true. Pairs of elements which differ by 1 are (4, 5), (10, 9) and (8, 9).
// 5. Given A = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5], the function should return false. There are no two elements in A whose values differ by 1.
// Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
// N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
// each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
