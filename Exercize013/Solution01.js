// A palindrome is a word, which reads the same backward as forward. Some examples of palindromes are: "kayak", 
// "radar", "mom".
// Write a function: class Solution { public String solution(int N, int K); } that, given two integers N and K, 
// returns a palindrome of length N which consists of K distinct lower-case letters (az
// Examples:
// 1. Given N = 5, K = 2, your function may return "abbba". There are many other possibilities; for example, it could also return "zdzdz". On the other hand, "aaaaa" is an incorrect answer as it contains only one distinct letter.
// 2. Given N = 8, K = 3, your function may return "ppsccspp".
// 3. Given N = 3, K = 2, your function may return "opo".
// Assume that:
// N is an integer within the range [1..200];
// K is an integer within the range [1..26];
// Creation of the required palindrome is always possible.
// In your solution, focus on correctness. 
// The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
